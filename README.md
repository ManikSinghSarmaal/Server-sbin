# Trash Classification Web App

This project is a web application that uses a yolov8 model refer to this repo [https://github.com/ManikSinghSarmaal/yolov8_sbin] for model weights (this repo contains pre-trained VGG16 model which was discontinued by me) to classify images of trash into three categories: Inorganic, Organic, and Metal. The application is built using FastAPI for the backend and HTML/JavaScript for the frontend.

## Features
